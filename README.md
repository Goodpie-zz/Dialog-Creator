# Dialog Tree Creator
Dialog tree creator web interface allows for creating simply dialog trees and exporting as JSON (WIP). Allows for the simple creation of:

- Text Nodes (Simple text dialog with one possible outcome)
- Question Nodes (Question dialog with multiple answers)

# Usage
1. Download the latest release and open index.html
2. Enter a title for your dialog tree
3. Add either a question or text
4. An input will show up with the Parent ID on the left and the current ID following. Add required information until dialog tree is complete
5. Click "Save all" and a dialog box should show up. Copy and past the included text into whatever text editor and save it as a JSON file
