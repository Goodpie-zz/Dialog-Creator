# Dialog Tree Creator
Dialog tree creator web interface allows for creating simply dialog trees and exporting as JSON (WIP). Allows for the simple creation of:

- Text Nodes (Simple text dialog with one possible outcome)
- Question Nodes (Question dialog with multiple answers)

# Usage
Dialog tree is currently in the middle of being developed and as such cannot be used at the current time.

# Progress and plans
